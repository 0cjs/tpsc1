tpsc1 - Tokyo Python Society Club
=================================

This is a sample project that the TPSC is doing to learn
more about creating Python things.


Running
-------

After installing any requirements listed below, just bring up a Bash
shell (terminal window on Linux/Mac, or "Git Bash here" from the
File Explorer right-click menu on Windows) and run `./Test`. This will
create the virtual environment, download the Python libraries and
programs it uses, and run the tests.


Requirements
------------

#### Python

* Debian/Ubuntu Linux: `apt-get install python3`
* Mac: `brew install python3` (maybe :-))
* Windows: Download and run the Windows executable or web-based
  installer from the [Python 3.6.5][pydl365] page.

#### Editor

You need an editor suitable for programming, so not Notepad.
(Notepad++ is ok, though.) If you don't currently have a preferred
editor, [Visual Studio Code][vscode] is powerful and popular.

As a programmer you will be spending more time with your editor than
with all other programs combined, so you should learn one editor well
and use it all the time, for all your tasks, on all systems.

#### Git

* Debian/Ubuntu Linux: `apt-get install git`
* Mac: `brew install git` (maybe, or maybe it comes with Git. Who knows.)
* Windows: You need [Git for Windows][gfw]. When installing it make
  sure you choose the following settings when prompted:
  - "Checkout as-is, commit as-is"
